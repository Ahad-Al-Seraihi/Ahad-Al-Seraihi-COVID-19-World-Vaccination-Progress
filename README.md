About
I performed basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib libraries on a Kaggle dataset looking at COVID-19 world vaccination progress in the period (12/2020 - 04/2021). This included data cleaning, wrangling and visualization to answer some hypotheses based on data.
